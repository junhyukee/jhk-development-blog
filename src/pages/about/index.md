Hey, everyone! I go by Jun, since even I find it difficult to pronounce Hyuk sometimes.



I am a full-stack developer, with a strong passion for building web applications. I am a problem solver that loves all types of challenges.



I graduated from the University of Southern California with a Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering. While I love the healthcare industry, my passion for software development has motivated me to chase my dream of building web applications!
